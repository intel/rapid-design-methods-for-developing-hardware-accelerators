## Updates
Googletest changed its library name in recent versions. Our latest code will not link to older versions. Please update googletest if you have link errors. (Feb. 6, 2019) Linking changed again for googletest (Oct. 16, 2019)

Now includes integration with [OPAE](https://01.org/OPAE) (Oct. 8, 2018). For an example, see `vectoradd` in the `chisel` subdirectory.

## Introduction
This project includes code and documentation to help software programmers and hardware engineers efficiently use platforms that include multi-core servers and FPGAs.

One challenge in using such systems is to effectively utilize the resources of the FPGA given the bandwidth and latency specifications imposed by this system. The link between the Accelerator Functional Unit (AFU) and the rest of the system is limited (at least) by the clock frequency and bit width of the interface. Read latency for items requiring DRAM access can be scores to hundreds of times slower than the FPGA clock frequency. Our design methodology can help you develop applications that successfully hide this latency and utilize the link at full system bandwidth.

We use SystemC to express the parallelism available in the AFU, and rely on commercial High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools to map this hardware description to Verilog (needed by the FPGA Synthesis, Place and Route tools.) We provide code generation flows to enable new SystemC users to become proficient quickly. Standardized memory interfaces (optimized for streaming and also random access patterns) are also provided, and well as schemes for creating multiple parallel AFUs that interface to the same (single) memory system.

Describing design memory interfaces and SystemC module and process structure in a Python-based DSL like this,
```python
from cog_acctempl import *

dut = DUT("vectoradd")

dut.add_ut( UserType("Blk",[ArrayField(UnsignedIntField("words"),16)]))

dut.add_rds( [TypedRead("Blk","ina","__inp_Slots__","1 << 30","1")])
dut.add_rds( [TypedRead("Blk","inb","__inp_Slots__","1 << 30","1")])
dut.add_wrs( [TypedWrite("Blk","out")])

dut.add_extra_config_fields( [BitReducedField(UnsignedIntField("n"),32)])

dut.module.add_cthreads( [CThread("fetcher",writes_to_done=True),
                          CThread("ina_addr_gen",ports=[RdReqPort("ina")]),
                          CThread("inb_addr_gen",ports=[RdReqPort("inb")]),
                          CThread("out_addr_gen",ports=[WrReqPort("out")])])

dut.get_cthread( "fetcher").add_ports( [RdRespPort("ina"),
                                        RdRespPort("inb"),
                                        WrDataPort("out")])
```
you need to write code like this to complete the functionality of a vector addition accelerator.
```cpp
void fetcher() { // (generated)
  inaRespIn.reset_get(); // type: MemTypedReadRespType<Blk> (generated)
  inbRespIn.reset_get(); // type: MemTypedReadRespType<Blk> (generated)
  outDataOut.reset_put(); // type: MemTypedWriteDataType<Blk> (generated)

  unsigned int ip = 0;

  done = false; // (generated)

  wait(); // (generated)
  while (1) { // (generated)
    if ( start) { // (generated)
      // check if it was the the last one (we process 16 elements at a time)
      if ( ip != (config.read().get_n() >> 4)) {
        // read two Blk objects, vector add (from class Blk), and write
        outDataOut.put( inaRespIn.get().data + inbRespIn.get().data);
        ++ip;
      } else {
        done = true;
      }
    } // (generated)
    wait(); // (generated)
  } // (generated)
} // (generated)
```
In all, more than 700 lines of SystemC intrastructure code in addition to the entire memory susbsystem is generated from less than 90 lines of the Python DSL spec and kernel code.


## Quickstart
Download SystemC and Googletest, compile and install. Set the environment variables `SC_DIR`, `GTEST_DIR`, and `HLD_ROOT`.
[See the wiki setup page.](https://github.com/intel/rapid-design-methods-for-developing-hardware-accelerators/wiki/Env-Setup)

`cd $HLD_ROOT/tutorials/memcpy/systemc; make`
